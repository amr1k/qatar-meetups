# Qatar Meetup

# Introduction

The aim of this Repo is to provide a step by step guide to follow along with the Qatar Meetups project. We will start off with a simple ESP8266 device sending humidity and temperature readings to GCP where will host our backend. The GCP will envolve showcasing the industry practices around building cloud native applications.

In addition to the following notes, you can also refer to the meetup specific branches in this repo.

## Meetup-1
The aim of this meetup is to provide a demo of the initial setup and distribute ESP8266 kits to the attendees. We demo'ed the working state of the application. The attendees can use the following videos as a guide to follow along and to build their own projects:

### [1. Infrastructure Setup for the meetup Project](https://youtu.be/yJMihVrPxqY)
### [2. Setting up the Postgres DB](https://youtu.be/v-vTbbonVzY)
### [3. Creating the DB Table and setting up the Application](https://youtu.be/uRMLdAT7IVA)
### [4. Testing the API using Postman](https://youtu.be/8JRQcDZZvic)
### [5. Hardware Wiring (ESP8266 and DHT)](https://youtu.be/VDZM8KQe3dE)
### [6. Arduino IDE Setup](https://youtu.be/5fGc6ESk0Uw)
### [7. Uploading the Device Code](https://youtu.be/s6gEjlAo8oU)

## Meetup-2
In this meetup we changed the application hosting to automatically scale with demand and remove the external IP address from the VM. We also saw what happens when the application gets hit with a large number of requests with autoscaling and without autoscaling.
